With no power to the B+ and B- bus bars, but with the current sensor and throttle attached, turn on the 12v power 
to the control board (red and black wires).  Put a volt meter positive lead on any one of GR1 .. GR10.  Put the 
negative lead on PH1 or PH2.  It should be 0v.  Now, turn up the throttle very slowly.  The voltage should climb, 
and then fall back to zero, and the LED should blink quickly.  

If that happens, the control board is probably good, and then I would hook up a motor to the controller, and then 
12v power to B+ and B-.  Make sure the B- of the 12v is isolated from the ground of the 12v battery you are using 
to power the control board.  Also, make sure you are precharging the capacitor bank through a precharge resistor 
before closing the contactor.  You won't have much speed control at 12v, but if the motor spins, then you are good 
to go.
